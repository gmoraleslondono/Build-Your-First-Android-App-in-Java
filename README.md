# Build-Your-First-Android-App-in-Java

## The goal

The goal is to build an app with 3 buttons:

- The first button shows a toast message (A toast is a short message that appears for a moment at the bottom of the screen).
- The second button initializes a counter that increases with each click.
- The third button directs to a second activity (different view) and shows a random number between 0 and the current count, in the previous click counter.

This project was developed following the tutorial [Build Your First Android App in Java](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app/#0) provided by Google Developers Codelabs.
